# ForUsersAppearanceMatters

 You work for a company that sells food products. You have to investigate the user behavior for the application of the company.  The design team wants to change the font for the entire application, but the management team is concerned that users will find the new design intimidating. That's why they decide to do an A/A/B test. 

 According to the results we find the following behaviors: 

* There are five types of events that happen in the following order: 
    * MainScreenAppear
    * OffersScreenAppear
    * CartScreenAppear
    * PaymentScreenSuccessful
    * Tutorial -> This Event is only frequently in special cases and it's out of the funnel process.

* Data provided is stable as of July 31, 2019.

* The step that lose more users is the `OffersScreenAppear` event with 35% of dropoff percentage of users. 

* 48% of the users complete all the stages of the events. 

* The experimental groups have approximately the same number of users:
    * A (246) -> 2484 users
    * A (247) -> 2513 users
    * B (248) -> 2537 users

* For all events, the groups are unchanged.

With this results we can conclude that the change of fonts for all the application will not affect the users behavior. The changes can be perform.
